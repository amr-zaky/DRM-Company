# Basic Project Repository

Welcome to the Base Project Repository! This repository serves as a solid foundation for building and expanding upon existing features or adding new ones to our flutter mobile project. Whether you're starting a new development effort or enhancing an existing application, this base project provides a structured and organized starting point.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this repository is to streamline the development process by providing a common structure and essential components for our flutter mobile project. It focuses on the following key features:

1. **Constants**: Centralize your application's constants, configuration values, and settings in one place for easy maintenance and access.

2. **Themes**: Create a consistent user interface by defining and managing themes, styles, colors, and design elements.

3. **Languages**: Manage internationalization (i18n) and localization (l10n) with support for multiple languages and translations using Bloc for state management.

4. **Connectivity**: Implement network connectivity and communication features using Dio for remote data and Bloc for state management.

5. **Data Sources**: Organize data sources, including remote data fetching via Dio and local data storage using Shared Preferences.
